Project 1: Social network analysis
----------

- The project is described in the [iPython notebook file](Project1.ipynb)
- You will also need to get the [data](gdelt.tgz)
- The project is due **February 21 at 5pm**. Draconian late penalties will be applied.
- As a reminder, the directed projects must be done independently (there were no objections to this change in the course syllabus).
