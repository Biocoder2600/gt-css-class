The class has the following graded components:

- Class participation, worth 5%. This is intended to motivate an engaging classroom discussion.
- Three problem sets, worth 15% each = 45%. 
- A final project, worth a total of 25%.
- Weekly reading responses, of which you must do ten, worth 2% each = 20%.
- Posting and describing a popular press item about social science research to the class tumblr, worth 5%.

## Deadlines ##

Problem sets and final project milestones may be turned in 24 hours late for 80% credit, and 48 hours late for 60% credit. After 48 hours late, the assignment will not be accepted. Reading responses are due by 1pm on the wednesday of class, and will not be accepted late.

## Collaboration ##

You are encouraged to discuss the problem sets and readings outside of class. However, everyone must submit their own work, and you may not share code or answers. If your discussion with another student helped you make a breakthrough on a difficult problem, give credit!

The final project may be performed in teams of at most three students.
