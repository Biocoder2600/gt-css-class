# Deadlines #

Problem sets and final project milestones may be turned in 24 hours late for 80% credit, and 48 hours late for 60% credit. After 48 hours late, the assignment will not be accepted. Reading responses are due by 1pm on the wednesday of class, and will not be accepted late.

# Collaboration #

You are encouraged to discuss the problem sets and readings outside of class. However, everyone must submit their own work, and you may not share code or answers. If your discussion with another student helped you make a breakthrough on a difficult problem, give credit!

The final project may be performed in teams of at most three students.

Suspected cases of honor code violations will be handled through the Office of Student Integrity. If you have a question about collaboration policy, please ask.
