## Class participation

## Paper presentations

Each wednesday, a team of two students will lead the discussion of an the day's assigned paper. This includes the following tasks:
- Prepare a presentation that highlights key claims of the paper, describes all figures and tables (using slides), and explain all methods in the paper. Note that this may necessitate additional reading or research. 
- Email two open-ended reading comprehension questions to the professor by 3pm on the preceding tuesday, which will be posed to the class.
- Lead the class discussion of the paper, soliciting comments from and posing questions to the other students.

## Labs

Students will choose three of the ten labs, and perform a significant extension of the lab material, e.g. 
- acquiring and analyzing additional data
- applying and comparing more analytical techniques
- visualizing the results in a way, etc. 

The extension must tackle a coherent research question. For ideas and feedback, please contact the professor in advance.

The lab report should be submitted as a readable Jupyter notebook, including both the .ipynb format and a PDF. The notebook should be runnable and readable top-to-bottom. If for some reason it is not possible to produce a runnable notebook (e.g., large or unshareable data), please check with the professor beforehand.
