All assignment submissions are due at 5pm. A penalty of 10% will be assessed for each day late (from 5:01pm until 5:00pm on the next day). Late assignments will not be accepted after four days.

# Class participation

This is a seminar class, and active participation in class discussions is mandatory. Students should attend each class ready to give informed reflections on the assigned reading.

# Paper presentations

Each wednesday, a team of two students will lead the discussion of an the day's assigned paper. This includes the following tasks:
- Prepare a presentation that highlights key claims of the paper, describes all figures and tables (using slides), and explain all methods in the paper. Note that this may necessitate additional reading or research. 
- Email two open-ended reading comprehension questions to the professor by 3pm on the preceding tuesday, which will be posed to the class.
- Lead the class discussion of the paper, soliciting comments from and posing questions to the other students.

# Reading responses

Reading responses will be due on wednesday, and will relate to wednesday's reading. They are worth one point each, up to a maximum of ten points. This means you may skip a few and still get full credit. However, they are due at the start of class, and will not be accepted late.

# Labs

Students will choose three of the ten labs, and perform a significant extension of the lab material, e.g. 
- acquiring and analyzing additional data
- applying and comparing more analytical techniques
- visualizing the results in a new way, etc. 

The extension should tackle a coherent research question. For ideas and feedback, please contact the professor in advance!

The lab report should be submitted on T-square as a well-organized Jupyter notebook, including both the .ipynb format and a PDF. The notebook should be runnable and readable top-to-bottom. If for some reason it is not possible to produce a runnable notebook (e.g., large or unshareable data), please check with the professor beforehand.

# Replication project

The final project in the class involves replicating and extending a published paper in computational social science. This project is to be performed in teams of 2-3 students, and the paper must be approved by the professor before the submission of the formal proposal. A list of recommended papers can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O9pofBgcqhAE7Oz9cw5XoSMu18jrR49e9O-I0xfu7OU/edit?usp=sharing).

The project has several checkpoints:

- **November 10**: Declare team intentions
- **November 13-15**: Check-in with professor about project ideas. Come to this meeting with a few papers already in mind, and information about what will be needed to replicate them.
- **November 17** Written [project proposal](#project-proposal) due
- **November 20** Give a short (5-6 minutes) presentation of the paper to be replicated in class. This presentation should highlight the main findings, and explain the planned replication and extension. All team members should attend.
- **November 27-29**: Check-in with professor about ongoing progress of replication and extension effort.
- **December 4**: [Poster presentations](#poster-presentation) in class
- **December 6**: [Final project reports](#project-report) due

"Replication" is interpreted broadly, but students are encouraged to reuse the original authors' data and algorithms where possible. The balance between replication and extension depends on the difficulty of replication, and the size of the team. For example, if the original authors provide well-curated data and a runnable software implementation, then a more significant extension is expected; if the student team must re-implement a significant amount of software or gather a large dataset of their own, then the extension component can be more limited.
