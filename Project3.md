Project 3: Independent Project
==========

This project will include multiple deliverables:
+ In-class presentation of your project proposal idea (April 1)
+ Written project proposal (April 4, 5PM)
+ Final presentation (April 24)
+ Initial writeup (New date: April 27, 5PM)
+ Final writeup (May 2, 5PM)

Although the first deliverable is not due until April 1, you should start thinking
about this project no later than the beginning of Spring Break (March 15).

# Project proposal #

Write 2-3 pages about what you plan to do. Ideally, someone else should be able to read this and carry out your project successfully.
Your proposal should include the following elements:

- Your goal, expressed as precisely as possible. 
- A summary of previous work towards this same goal. Identify at least three related efforts, whether in research papers, blogs, commercial products, etc.
- What's new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?
- Who cares if you succeed? (Who would this project impact, and how)
- What are the risks for failure, and how can they be minimized?
- What resources will you need? If you need datasets that are not publicly downloadable, you should have already started contacting people to try to get them. Explain what steps you have already taken to get these resources, what steps you plan to take, and what you will do if you cannot get the resources you want.
- How long will it take? Give a step-by-step explanation of your path to your goal, with the expected amount of time required per step.
- What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?

These points are adapted from a guide from how to write grant proposals. In a way, the goal of your project proposal is to convince me to give you the "green light" for your project. Your proposal should convince me that you have a clear plan, an understanding of prior work, the necessary resources for success, and metrics that will measure whether the project is a success or failure.

The project proposal presentation is worth three points; the proposal itself is worth five points.

# Final presentation #

(Five points)

Aim to talk for seven minutes about your work (this means you should have 5-7 slides). Remind us what problem you are trying to solve or what phenomenon you want to test, and why it matters. Explain what you did, and whether it works. You should aim to have your experiments done by the time of the presentation.

# Project report #

(Seventeen points)

Your project report should provide a complete description of what you did in your project, including all the points that you covered in your proposal and presentation:

- **What is your project's objective?** For example, Jurafsky et al wanted to identify the linguistic features that correlate with perceptions of interpersonal stances such as flirtatiousness and friendliness.
- **Why is it important?** Draw connections to theory and/or practical applications. For example, Bond et al had an easy case: they demonstrated that a simple widget on Facebook could increase the number of people who vote. In another example, by demonstrating that multimodal features improve sentiment analysis, Perez-Rosas et al make a convincing argument that future systems should use these features.
- **Who else has worked on this problem, what have they done, and how is your project different?** For example, Tan et al mention prior work on retweet prediction including Petrovic et al, but note that the prior work did not control for author and topic.
- If your project is quantitative, **what is your data source**? Explain how it was acquired, what are its limitations (if any), what preprocessing you did (and why). For example, Bollen et al note how they started with a Twitter feed, and then used simple patterns to extract tweets that express first-person feelings.
- **How did you analyze the data? What was your null model, and why is it justified?** For example, Choi and Varian show that autoregressive models with search log features often do better than comparable models with several other useful predictors -- not just better than chance.
- **What conclusions can you draw?** Why are these conclusions justified? For example, Bamman et al draw a number of conclusions, including that the rate of message deletion in Chinese social media varies widely by province.
- **Use specific examples to bolster high-level conclusions**: for example, if you find that unigram text features predict retweets, then show some of the words which are the strongest predictors (like Tan et al); if you find network centrality correlates with microfinance participation, give some examples of highly-central individuals and non-central individuals, and describe their outcomes. *This is especially important if you use unsupervised techniques such as clustering*, since the output of these techniques is otherwise opaque to the reader.

As always, **well-designed** graphs and tables are more helpful than lots of text. Use the papers that we have read in class for guidance on how to write and structure your report. But keep in mind that each paper has idiosyncasies and possibly flaws, so think critically about what does and doesn't work in these papers.

There are two deadlines:

- "Initial" deadline. Due to popular demand, I've postponed this to 5pm on Sunday April 27.
- "Final" deadline: 5pm on May 2. This one is not negotiable. 

I will grade your initial submission. If you like your grade, you can keep it. If not, you can resubmit for the final deadline, and your final grade will be the average of the two.

- If you submit your initial writeup by Friday 5pm April 25 (the original deadline), I'll return it to you by noon on Monday April 28. 
- If you submit your initial writeup by the new deadline of Sunday 5pm April 27, I'll return it to you by noon on Wednesday April 30.
