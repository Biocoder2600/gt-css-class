Project 3: Independent Project
==========

This project will include multiple deliverables:
+ In-class presentation of your project proposal idea (April 1)
+ Written project proposal (April 4, 5PM)
+ Final presentation (April 24)
+ Initial writeup (April 25, 5PM)
+ Final writeup (May 2, 5PM)

Although the first deliverable is not due until April 1, you should start thinking
about this project no later than the beginning of Spring Break (March 15).

# Project proposal #

Write 2-3 pages about what you plan to do. Ideally, someone else should be able to read this and carry out your project successfully.
Your proposal should include the following elements:

- Your goal, expressed as precisely as possible. 
- A summary of previous work towards this same goal. Identify at least three related efforts, whether in research papers, blogs, commercial products, etc.
- What's new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?
- Who cares if you succeed? (Who would this project impact, and how)
- What are the risks for failure, and how can they be minimized?
- What resources will you need? If you need datasets that are not publicly downloadable, you should have already started contacting people to try to get them. Explain what steps you have already taken to get these resources, what steps you plan to take, and what you will do if you cannot get the resources you want.
- How long will it take? Give a step-by-step explanation of your path to your goal, with the expected amount of time required per step.
- What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?

These points are adapted from a guide from how to write grant proposals. In a way, the goal of your project proposal is to convince me to give you the "green light" for your project. Your proposal should convince me that you have a clear plan, an understanding of prior work, the necessary resources for success, and metrics that will measure whether the project is a success or failure.
