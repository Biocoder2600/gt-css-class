# Goals

The principle aim for this graduate seminar is to develop a broad
understanding of the emerging cross-disciplinary field of Computational Social Science.
This includes:
+ Quantitative analysis of social phenomena
+ Models of network structure
+ Methods for text analysis
+ Applications to social science fields, such as political science, sociolinguistics, sociology, and economics

Additional learning objectives include:
- Reading and understanding contemporary research papers
- Presenting concise and informative summaries of published research
- Executing computational social science research, through labs and a replication project

# Readings

Monday readings will be about computational methods. They will largely be drawn from the following textbooks, all of which are available online:

- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani
- [An Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/tree/master/notes) by Eisenstein
- [Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/) by Sagalnik
- [Networks, Crowds, and Markets](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/) by Easley and Kleinberg

Wednesday readings will usually be research papers, mostly from the social sciences. These readings will be presented by teams of 2-3 students. We will also spend half of (most) wednesdays on in-class labs.
