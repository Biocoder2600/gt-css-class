Georgia Tech CS 8803-CSS: Computational Social Science
============

The principle aim for this graduate seminar is to develop a broad
understanding of the emerging cross-disciplinary field of Computational Social Science.
This includes:
+ Methodological foundations in network and content analysis:
  understanding the mathematical basis for these methods, as well as
  their practical application to real data.
+ Best practices and limitations of observational studies.
+ Applications to political science, sociolinguistics, sociology,
psychology, economics, and public health.

Assignments and Grading
----

This is a seminar-style class, and will emphasize classroom
discussion. For this reason, it is essential that students do
the readings in advance of the lecture.

+ Classroom participation: 10%
+ Weekly blogposts summarizing the reading, and raising relevant issues for classroom discussion: 30%
+ Two research blogposts, in which students apply techniques from the course to shared datasets: 30%
+ One indepedendent project, in which students apply techniques from the course to a dataset of their choice: 30%

The weekly blogposts should demonstrate your understanding of the assigned reading, and raise questions for classroom discussion.

The shared-data research blogposts should use the techniques in the
class to explore a shared dataset, and attempt to answer one or two
arguable questions about the data. (Excellent) examples of the style
of work that I'm looking for can be found
[here](http://tedunderwood.com/2012/02/26/the-differentiation-of-literary-and-nonliterary-diction-1700-1900/),
[here](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4681), and
[here](http://idibon.com/the-weirdest-languages/).  This project can
be done in teams of at most three, but expectations will reflect the
number of group members. The shared-data projects will require both
original work as well as a small number of compulsory analyses that
cover key concepts from the course.

The independent project should be substantive, original work in the
area of computational social science. This can include: a new study
using techniques described in the course; a refinement of the
techniques described in the course; a novel survey paper that provides
a unified treatment of an area of computational social science.  This
should represent roughly the same amount of work as the two
shared-data blogposts, and can be done in teams of up to three
students.

Students may audit the course, but all students who attend must perform the
weekly blogposts about the reading, to facilitate discussion.
