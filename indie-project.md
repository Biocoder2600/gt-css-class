# Independent final project #

In the independent final project, you will replicate (and possibly build on) a previously-published paper in Computational Social Science. You can work in a team, with the recommended size of two, plus or minus one.

Here's the timeline, with details below.

- **Project proposal** due Friday April 3 at 11:59pm. This will be *at most* two pages, but should reflect some considered thought. 20% credit.
- **Project check-in** on April 13 or 15, during class. This is for your benefit, so do whatever it takes to make the most use of the available time. 10% credit.
- **Project presentations** on April 20, during class. Count on roughly five minutes per person. 20% credit.
- **Final project reports** due April 24, at 11:59pm. You should write *at most* four pages, plus two pages per member of your team. 50% credit.

## Paper ideas ##

Here are some papers from the class readings that I think could plausibly be replicated and extended in your final project. No guarantees, it's up to you to make sure! I can help you brainstorm about data if you've identified a project that's especially promising. 
- [The cost of racial animus on a Black presidential candidate: Using Google search data to find what surveys miss](http://static.squarespace.com/static/51d894bee4b01caf88ccb4f3/t/51d89ab3e4b05a25fc1f39d4/1373149875469/RacialAnimusAndVotingSethStephensDavidowitz.pdf)
- [Understanding the political representativeness of Twitter users](https://files.nyu.edu/pba220/public/barbera-rivero-2014.pdf). The ideology-modeling part of this paper might be hard to replicate, but you could make up for this by extending it in other ways, such as focusing on other countries.
- [A computational approach to politeness](http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/pubs/politeness-acl13.pdf) by Cristian Danescu-Nicolescu-Mizil et al, 2013.
- [Inferring social ties from geographic coincidences](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22436.full.pdf+html) by Crandall et al, 2010. You might not be able to get this Flickr data, but might be able to try to replicate the experiment on Twitter or some other site.
- [Find me if you can](http://www.cameronmarlow.com/media/backstrom-geographical-prediction_0.pdf) by Backstrom et al. Again, you probably can't get the Facebook data, but might be able to use another data source.
- [The Slashdot Zoo: Mining a social network with negative edges](http://www.dai-labor.de/fileadmin/Files/Publikationen/Buchdatei/kunegis2009a_The_Slashdot_Zoo___Mining_a_Social_Network_with_Negative_Edges.pdf) by Kunegis et al, 2009.
- [Signed networks in social media](http://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/triads-chi10.pdf) by Leskovec et al, 2010.
- [Extracting Signed Social Networks From Text](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W12-4102) by Hassan, Abu-Jbara, and Radev, 2012.
- [Predicting crime using Twitter and Kernel Density Estimation](http://ptl.sys.virginia.edu/ptl/sites/default/files/manuscript_gerber.pdf) by Gerber, 2013.
- [Exploiting social network structure for person-to-person sentiment analysis](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~west1/TACL2014/) by West et al, 2014.
- [Linguistic Models for Analyzing and Detecting Biased Language](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Biased_language_files/neutrality.pdf) by Recasens et al. 
- [Shedding (a thousand points of) light on biased language](http://mlt.sv.cmu.edu/mlt/research/conferences/naacl2010/MTURK/pdf/MTURK23.pdf). There's no budget for Mechanical Turk, so you'd need to find some other way to get these annotations.
- [Detecting and modeling local text reuse](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dasmith/infect-dl-2014.pdf). This involves some heavy-duty software engineering, but some of you might find that fun.
- [Narrative framing of consumer sentiment in online restaurant reviews](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4944/3863)
- [Phrases that signal workplace hierarchy](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2145359) by Gilbert
- [Political ideology detection using recursive neural networks](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/docs/2014_acl_rnn_ideology.pdf) by Iyyer et al. Warning, the machine learning component of this paper is significant.
- [More than Words: Syntactic Packaging and Implicit Sentiment](http://ftp.cfar.umd.edu/users/resnik/pubs/greene_resnik_naacl2009.pdf) by Greene and Resnick. This paper involves an experiment with 31 participants. You'd have to explain how you can do something comparable.
- [Learning to extract international relations from political context](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nasmith/papers/oconnor+stewart+smith.acl13.pdf). Warning, the machine learning and NLP components of this paper are intensive.
- [Echoes of power: Language effects and power differences in social interaction](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html) by Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Lee, Pang, Kleinberg, 2012
- [The effect of wording on message propagation: Topic- and author-controlled natural experiments on Twitter](http://chenhaot.com/pubs/wording-effects-message-propagation.pdf) by Tan, Lee, and Pang. 

You may propose to select a paper that is not on this list, but if so, I strongly recommend that you check with me first. The main criteria are that:

- The paper should be published in a reputable venue.
- It should be related to a social science question.
- It should involve interesting computational techniques.
- It should be feasible to replicate and possibly extend in the a period of a few weeks.

## The project proposal ##

Your team should submit a single, two-page proposal describing what you plan to do. Specifically, you should indicate:

- **Who** is on the team
- **What** paper you plan to replicate
- **Why** you want to replicate this paper
- **Data**: what you need, and where you can get it
- **Methods**: what computational techniques do you plan to employ, and how will you do it? Will you write your own code? Is there a software library you can use?
- **Metrics**: How will you know if you have succeeded in replicating the paper? Be as specific as possible.
- **Risks**: What might go wrong that would cause this project to fail? What can you do to ameliorate these risks, and what will you do in this worst-case scenario?
- **Stretch goals**: In case the initial idea proves "too easy", how can you go beyond replication, to make an original contribution of your own.

## The presentation ##

The project presentation is an opportunity to show off your hard work, and to get feedback towards your final report. Plan on spending roughly five minutes per team member. Use the time well by:

- Explaining your goals as clearly as possible. Start with the assumption that nobody has read the paper that you're replicating. Explain why the research is important, and relate it to other concepts in the class.
- Describing the methods that you used, and why they were expected to work.
- Presenting the results of your efforts, emphasizing well-designed figures and graphics, rather than text and tables.

## The final report ##

Your project report should provide a complete description of what you did in your project, including all the points that you covered in your proposal and presentation:

- **What is your project's objective?** For example, Jurafsky et al wanted to identify the narrative structures that correlate with various types of restaurant reviews.
- **Why is it important?** Draw connections to theory and/or practical applications. For example, Bamman et al showed how it was possible to better understand internet censorship, which affects the way millions of people get information and express themselves.
- **Who else has worked on this problem, what have they done, and how is your project different?** For example, Tan et al mention prior work on retweet prediction including Petrovic et al, but note that the prior work did not control for author and topic.
- If your project is quantitative, **what is your data source**? Explain how it was acquired, what are its limitations (if any), what preprocessing you did (and why). 
- **How did you analyze the data? What was your null model, and why is it justified?** For example, Stephens-Davidowitz compared against several competitive models, which included many strong predictors. He showed that the rate of racially-charged search terms added predictive power even above these competitive alternatives.
- **What conclusions can you draw?** Why are these conclusions justified? For example, Bamman et al draw a number of conclusions, including that the rate of message deletion in Chinese social media varies widely by province.
- **Use specific examples to bolster high-level conclusions**: for example, if you find that unigram text features predict retweets, then show some of the words which are the strongest predictors (like Tan et al); if you find network centrality correlates with microfinance participation, give some examples of highly-central individuals and non-central individuals, and describe their outcomes. *This is especially important if you use unsupervised techniques such as clustering*, since the output of these techniques is otherwise opaque to the reader.

As always, **well-designed** graphs and tables are more helpful than lots of text. Use the papers that we have read in class for guidance on how to write and structure your report. But keep in mind that each paper has idiosyncasies and possibly flaws, so think critically about what does and doesn't work in these papers.

You should write at most four pages, plus two pages per member of your team. For example, if you work by yourself, you can write at most six pages. The bibliography does not count towards this limit.
