Project 2: Social network analysis
----------

- The project is described in the [iPython notebook file](pset-2.ipynb)
- You will also need to get the data, which is available on t-square.
- The project is due **March 1 at 5pm**. Draconian late penalties will be applied.
- As a reminder, the directed projects must be done independently.
- In the independent part of the project, you can use the political donations data, which is also on t-square. To get started with this data, see the [networkx demo](../class-notes/networkx demo.ipynb) that I posted on the github.
