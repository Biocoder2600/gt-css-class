Lab 1: Github, Python, Jupyter, Dataframes
===========

Before class on Wednesday, you should:

- Clone this github repository to your own computer. [Getting started with git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). 
	- Alternatively, you can  [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository, so that you have your own copy on github. Careful: this will be publicly viewable by default. I'm not sure whether it's possible to fork the repository over to your github.gatech account.
- Install python. I generally use python 2.7, but am trying to make the labs python 3 compatible.
- Install several libraries: jupyter, pandas, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
	- You can do this using pip
	- Or you can install anaconda
